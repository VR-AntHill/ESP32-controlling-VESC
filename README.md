# ESP32-controlling-VESC
rough cut version of a esp32 controlling the VESC on my DPV. Based on blatently stolen snippets, plus whaever I managed to throw together without messing up too badly.
Needs cleaning up!
The main file contains most of the definitions, the startup and the processes for each core. Note that the "loop" is empty, as each core has it's own handler. At the end is the portion that handles the multi-click from the trigger to initiate cruise-control and boost power
Core 0 handles wifi, over-the-air update (OTA), and the SFTP server so you can read out the data log file via filezilla.
Core 1 handles the serial communication with the VESC, reads the trigger, rotarty magnet status as speed setting, and writes the log file.
